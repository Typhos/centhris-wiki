      "@+Kerathax+@ (crow-ZEM-gax), the Lord of Ash, was a legendary, ancient red dragon that, in the centuries following the Ruination of Centhris, slowly became the tyrannical ruler of a huge area in the shadow of the northern Jordonis Mountains. The dragon, which matured and rose to power in the chaotic vacuum of the post-Ruination era, was able to carved out an extensive domain in the shadow of Ashspire Peak following the Utharian Empire's destruction."

        "Kerathax is theorized to have been part of a clutch of eggs birthed several hundred years after the @;Ruination of Centhris;@ by another dragon of legend, Zethostria the Voidfury. According to followers of the Kerathax, the wyrm was the strongest of its clutch and quickly disposed of most of its weaker kin.",
        "As he grew, the red dragon began to amass followers. At first this only amounted to a small band of kobolds, but over time, the wyrm began to gather other, more powerful subjects. By 2C 1700, Kerathax, now nearly 900 years old, had claimed dominion over numerous towns, castles and even a dwarven hold. Numerous cults to the red wyrm had formed, with followers of numerous humanoid races. Though some worshiped the dragon out of awe and respect, most did so out of fear for its terrible wrath, which it brought down with little warning when displeased."

      "Assault on Frecyra": [
        "As the various kingdoms in the Kelishan Highlands, Galren Moor and Tidewrack Coast began to transition from spare, desperate settlements into expansive, complex societies, they slowly began to come into conflict with the red dragon and its followers. At first, the dragon saw this as an amusing attempt by lesser begins to challenge the draconic masters of the Tempus Draconis, but as other great wyrms fell, Kerathax grew angry.",
        "In 2C 2130, the red wyrm struck an unexpected blow. Setting out from its lair at Ashspire Peak, the dragon attempted to raze Frecyra, the Fortress City of the Galren Moor, to the ground in a single night. Though the dragon did incredible damage, it was ultimately unsuccessful due to intervention of an organization it had grossly underestimated, the Nost Ezel'nar. The ancient dragon retreated back to its lair to plan its next move."

      "Battle of Ashspire Peak": [
        "In the aftermath of the sudden aggression of the elder dragon, the leaders of the nearby kingdoms, Azond, Dunfeld, Malstein, Navolin and Vacelin, gathered to determine a course of action. After much debate, the decision was reached to strike directly at the dragon's lair. Thus, the Ashbreaker Coalition was formed.",
