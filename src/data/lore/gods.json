        "@+The Guardian+@, Bahamut, is the God-King of all good dragons and the protector of mortals. Bahamut is one of the the most renowned gods among mortal races of Centhris, and is said to command a deep respect within the Pantheon, even from those who would view him as an enemy. The Guardian and his worshipers value life, and do not harm other creatures needlessly. In battle, his servants follow a strict code of martial conduct, and generally are unwilling to harm an opponent that is unable to defend itself.",
        "The Guardian is said to be proud beyond reproach. His canon states that pride is necessary for any creature to be magnanimous; one has to believe in standards for themselves, and strive to surpass them, before standards can be applied to others. Many followers adhere to this ideal, often resulting other viewing his church as haughty and aloof."

His church teaches its followers to always uphold the highest ideals of honor and justice; to be constantly vigilant against evil and to oppose it from all fronts; and to protect the weak, liberate the oppressed, and defend just order. The Guardian is said to advocate a 'greater justice' that includes fighting against evil and toppling oppressive regimes. The church also is keen to reward strength of purpose and character in his followers.",
          "The Church of the Guardian holds a strong central structure and canon which includes the Leges Aequitatis. Each church of the Celestial Dragon contains a central pillar, shrine or statue of the Dragon King which displays the church's code. Every follower of the church of the Guardian, and most people with a passing knowledge of religious rites are able to recite it. The major tenants of the Leges Aequitatis are:",

Instead, the church seeks to hold itself up as an ideal that others might strive to meet.",

          "The Church of the Guardian teaches its followers that the truest communion with their god is through active expressions of bravery, heroism and self sacrifice. Young men and women called to his service often travel Centhris seeking to do good in his name. These Paladins and Clerics are collectively known as Valiant Knights or Valiants. Many of these followers actively seek to root out evil and defend those who cannot defend themselves, and many are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their patron.",
          "The Valiant Knights are generally revered by the common folk of Centhris. They are seen as protectors, champions and paragons of good. Questing knights and clerics of the Guardian are regularly welcomed into peasant homes, and provided with food and a place to rest. Occasionally, charlatans will masquerade as Valiants, duping a desperate or ignorant populace. Such acts are regarded as an affront to the the Platinum Dragon and his true servants are charged with seeking out and dispensing justice to any who would sully their gods name.",
          "The Valiants also have earned a reputation for being dragon slayers, or dragon knights. The church actively opposes the activities of chromatic dragons on Centhris and his followers are keenly aware that if they do not remain vigilant, the powerful servants of the Wyrm could bring ruin upon the Prime Materium."

        "Relations with other Faiths": [
          "While the Church of the Guardian and its followers are revered by the common folk, followers of other gods and those of station tend to find the church cumbersome. The ideals of the Celestial Dragon are lofty, they do not match the reality of the world around them. The followers of the Guardian tend to view the world in black and white, while most others understand that the world is, in fact, a wide spectrum of morally gray choices.",
          "The followers and churches of some other deities maintain good relations with the Church of the Guardian. The churches of the Maker, the Arbiter and the Tempest have varying degrees of interaction with the followers of the Guardian. Though none of these followers see completely eye to eye, they all understand that they stand as a common bloc against others that might threaten the safety, order and dignity of the societies their patrons guard. The church and the Cult of the Champion often overlap in times of war, as soldiers venerate the Champion while also embracing the protection of the Guardian. Faithful of the Guardian find those who follow Isilena to be keen allies, but often differ on what motivates their actions, as the followers of Bahamut wish to instill order, while heroes of the Champion focus on doing good regardless of its effect on the order of the world.",

          "The Church of the Guardian canon demands the seeking and directly opposition of the acts of, though not the existence of, the churches of the Wyrm, the Stygian and the Fiend. Other evil gods and their cults are viewed with suspicion, but their aims only occasionally require direct intervention from the Valiants, and the champions of the Guardian do not actively seek out their members."

High atop the heavens, it stands as a massive palace, the exterior plated with platinum, reflecting the light of heaven like a impossibly bright lighthouse. Inside of the marble halls of dragon god's home, many exotic materials can be found: precious metals, astral ivory and gemstones of incredible size decorate windows and mithral walls. This is not just for vanity: the Celestial Dragon's gigantic palace is said to serve as remind the other gods of the Guardian's might, and on a more basic level, it also serves as his hoard. It is here, atop the Divine Lighthouse that he holds court, deals with other deities and beings of near similar power, and passes judgment on the wicked."

It is said that so perfect is the Harlequin's mimicry of even their fellow gods that on numerous occasions the Harlequin has impersonated other divines without their fellow deities being aware.",

At most, a specific cult of the Harlequin may take sides in local issues, as artists often do, but this comes from the individuals of the group choosing a side personally and not due to their faith.",

Many clerics of lawful gods complain that they must always track down and corner a follower of the Harlequin when they need them, as the Masked God's followers quickly lose interest in maintaining interfaith ties.",

A common myth in the tales of both faiths is of the merciless mockery that the Harlequin visits upon Asmodeus in ballads and songs. It is claimed that the first time the Eye of Vel'dorin erupted, it was due to the Master's rage at a particularly skewering poem Jandivar read aloud in the Halls of Tanrilar disparaging the Lord of Nessus' large, curved horns as a cover for his inadequacy in ...other areas."

Sailors will often pray to the Tempest for protection on voyages, seeking his guiding hand in their journey.",
      "The legends of the gods claim that Ukrom views the Conqueror as both a great rival and a drinking companion. The two, though completely opposed in their ideology are battle brothers who value each other's strength. It is said that the two gods have held 999 contests of strength. The cult of the Tempest claims that Ukrom has bested his brother a single time more, while the Church of the Conqueror claims that Aegeroth has the edge in the godly contest."

        "The Cult of the Tempest has little in the way of formal dogma which members are expected to follow. The few commandment handed down by leaders of the faith are:",
        "• Be strong, but do not use your strength for destruction or oppression.",
        "• Heed the waves and squalls, but overcome it with your might.",
        "• Be brave. Scorn cowardice in any form. A proud warrior embraces a glorious end.",

        "Though the Tempest does not have a large, formal clerical structure, he does earn many followers, especially with those who value strength and physical prowess. The temples of the Tempest are generally structures that double as arenas or gymnasiums. His festivals generally involve feasts and contests of strength. These can often overlap with festivals to the Conqueror, with whom the followers of the Tempest share a veneration of strength.",
        "Clerics and Paladins of the the Tempest are typically powerful, athletic men and women who settle conflicts with their weapons or fists instead of attempting to hash out a verbal resolution to a conflict. There is no place for weakness among the followers of the Tempest, and it is well known that to insult a follower of Ukrom will almost always result in a brawl."

      "Veneration of the Tempest Nautica": [
        "The Tempest shares dominion over the seas with the Leviathan, whom he is said to have battled numerous times, resulting in great maelstroms and hurricanes. Generally, Veluria is feared and paid homage to avoid her wrath, while offerings to Ukrom are made before a voyage in the hope that he will grant the sailors his protection.",
        "Most major ports have a temple dedicated to the Tempest Nautica and many fishing villages keep a shrine to the tempest on a location overlooking the shore. In this way, sailors may conduct rites of veneration before heading out onto the waves. Generally, the longer and more daring the voyage, the larger the offering that is made. This generally comes in the form of a tithe to the temple, a grand feast or a display of strength or athleticism, such as a wrestling contest with the champion of the temple."
      ],
      "Cult of the Tempest Karsoz": [
        "The people of Cibrin embrace the teachings of Ukrom unquestioningly. They value strength, glory and adventure so completely that they embrace the Ukrom's @*Aspect of Glory*@, his commandment to seek out valor and glory aggressively. Many members of the clans of Cibrin will regularly call for adventurous souls willing to serve in mercenary companies in foreign lands, so long as they do not act against their homeland. Many coastal tribes will form raiding parties and sail out into the Venngar Sea and on to the Korin Gulf to raid the coasts of Lemuria, Tovanis or Zurast. Though momentary enrichment is a benefit of such actions, many of the raiders do not seek physical wealth, but instead hope to earn glory and honor @*Tempest Karsoz*@."

To the powerful and learned, the Fiend is considered the most dangerous and powerful threat to the stability of the mortal world, for he is the supreme lord of all demons, the commander of the infinite chaos the Burning Abyss, and a warrior to rival the Guardian and the Champion.
