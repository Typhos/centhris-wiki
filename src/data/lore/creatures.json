The golems outer hull is made of a magically-infused iron, while the inside contains numerous magical seals, mechanisms and foci to help power and control the construct.",

        "The golems serve the city of Rakenburg as arcane sentinels as part of the Specula Arcanum, the Rakenburg guild responsible for the protection of the city. The Specs operate in small patrol teams and it is common for a single iron golem to accompany each team. Each team's golem is controlled by the patrol leader, who is given a magical device that lets them command the golem vocally. Should the squad become incapacitated, the Gradiorus can be controlled by the guild remotely in order to prevent hostile actors from taking control of one of the city's most powerful defensive tools."

Eskra Gradiorus, the tiefling artificer, was the first to take an interest in the constructs and through extensive research and reverse-engineering, she was able to activate and reprogram the golems to serve the city."

      "Native to the Venngar Sea, Icebrine Serpents are a species of aggressive, deep sea predators. These aquatic dragons are covered in large, hard scales that range from deep blue to pale green. They have a single pair of clawed arms a third of the way down their body that end in three razor-sharp talons. They feel most at home among the ice flows and icebergs of the frigid, arctic oceans of Centhris.",
      "Icebrine Serpents hold a legendary reputation among the cold-water seafaring nations of the world, such as Cibrin, Lemuria and Talhurst. Many sailors tell harrowing tales of horrific monsters that stalk ships for days, waiting for an opportune moment to strike, such as rough seas or a sudden maelstrom. When an Icebrine Serpent strikes, it will attempt to break a ship's hull with its jaws and claws, blast sailors from the deck with a jet of briny water, or knock sailors overboard with its tail."

Numerous tales of mythic heroes, such as the legendary Lemurian hero Stolkar Wyrmbreaker, involve battles with a serpent. Such is the reputation of these beasts that their true nature and capabilities have been lost among the uneducated masses. Common folk will regularly attribute abilities or supernatural powers to Icebrine Serpents that they are not capable of, simply out of ignorance or the increasing tall tales of a local tavern."
