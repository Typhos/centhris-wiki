The Specs operate in small patrol teams and it is common for a single iron golem to accompany each team. Each team's golem is controlled by the patrol leader, who is given a magical device that lets them command the golem vocally. Should the squad become incapacitated, the Gradiorus can be controlled by the guild remotely in order to prevent hostile actors from taking control of one of the city's most powerful defensive tools."

They have a single pair of clawed arms a third of the way down their body that end in three razor-sharp talons. They feel most at home among the ice flows and icebergs of the frigid, arctic oceans of Centhris.",

Many sailors tell harrowing tales of horrific monsters that stalk ships for days, waiting for an opportune moment to strike, such as rough seas or a sudden maelstrom. When an Icebrine Serpent strikes, it will attempt to break a ship's hull with its jaws and claws, blast sailors from the deck with a jet of briny water, or knock sailors overboard with its tail."

Common folk will regularly attribute abilities or supernatural powers to Icebrine Serpents that they are not capable of, simply out of ignorance or the increasing tall tales of a local tavern."
