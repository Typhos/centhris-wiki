The Specs operate in small patrol teams and it is common for a single iron golem to accompany each team. Each team's golem is controlled by the patrol leader, who is given a magical device that lets them command the golem vocally. Should the squad become incapacitated, the Gradiorus can be controlled by the guild remotely in order to prevent hostile actors from taking control of one of the city's most powerful defensive tools."

They have a single pair of clawed arms a third of the way down their body that end in three razor-sharp talons. They feel most at home among the ice flows and icebergs of the frigid, arctic oceans of Centhris.",

Many sailors tell harrowing tales of horrific monsters that stalk ships for days, waiting for an opportune moment to strike, such as rough seas or a sudden maelstrom. When an Icebrine Serpent strikes, it will attempt to break a ship's hull with its jaws and claws, blast sailors from the deck with a jet of briny water, or knock sailors overboard with its tail."

Having achieved lichdom several hundred years prior to his complete domination of the Kingdom of Istagen, the lich found that though many wizards publicly spoke out against the practice of magical undeath, in private they were far more willing to entertain such ideas. Thus, the lich lord slowly began to find willing mages whom he felt were worthy (and subservient) enough to join his inner circle, which would eventually grow to become known as the Council of the Withered King.",
        "Once a wizard had accepted the terms of his dark bargain, @~Shulxaa~@ would create for them a phylactery in which the mage would transfer their life force, becoming a lich. However, the secret of the creation of such objects, as well as their individual hiding places, were never shared with his servants, as a means of control by the Lich Lord. Thus, the council members, even if they might be tempted, would never overly act against their master. Shulxaa also went to great lengths over the course of his reign over Istagen to ensure that the knowledge of how to create a phylactery was never available to his servants, as a further way to ensure their loyalty."

As long as this phylactery is unharmed, the lich is immortal and can attempt to reassemble if it is ever vanquished (this happens within 10 days after its apparent destruction). Liches take great care in protecting their phylactery from harm, employing decoys, traps, and other defenses. Lesser liches guard their soul containers even more jealously than a true lich, if such a thing were possible, as they do not have the required knowledge create their own. Instead, they are closer to thralls, relying on the knowledge of a master lich, in order to store their soul in a phylactery."

      "The @+Syrothian Blackfire Drake+@ is most commonly found in the Rostamas, located in north-central Ulfwyst. These aggressive predators are prized as battle mounts for the elite Blackfire Dragoons of the Syrothian Immortal Legions. The dragon's name is derived from their unique ability to produce dark flames inside their mouth and throat. Unlike full dragons, these smaller cousins cannot project this flame as a breath weapon, instead using it to cook their prey before digesting it."

        "Though a terrifying natural predator in its own right, Blackfire drakes do not naturally travel beyond their hunting grounds in the Rostamas. It was the hobgoblins of the Syrothian Empire who first saw the potential for the beasts as war mounts. After numerous failed attempts to tame fully grown adult drakes, it was determined that the best approach for domesticating the creatures was to raise them from birth.",
        "After a clutch of eggs are successfully hatched (a difficult task in its own right, as a clutch of eggs must be kept just above freezing for keeps to successfully hatch) it takes a newborn drake roughly 2 years to reach maturity. During this time, they must be fed a steady diet of raw meat and be trained extensively in order to prevent them from attacking their master while mounted in the saddle.",
        "Even with extensive battle training, these dragonkin are still too wild and savage to fight in regimented tactics of the Immortal Legions. Instead, each Blackfire Dragoon is expected to be a fully autonomous warrior, capable of fighting independently, or in small war bands, in order to avoid the drakes attacking each other, or other riders out of sheer savage aggression."
