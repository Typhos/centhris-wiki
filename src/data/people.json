			"Previously the Alderman of Rythlon, Selif Koric is an elderly man who lived in a house on the village square. He has long, grey hair, a well kept bear and a dull, passive demeanor. Seemingly either inept or corrupt, Koric appeared to be generally uninterested in the plight of the people in Rythlon under the watchful eye of Teliril Wasanathi.",
			"He first encountered the Adventurers when they brought Davrik and Gregor to his house in the middle of the night, after the men had been captured smuggling goods on the Sulas river. Koric seemed uninterested in the issue until Teliril arrived at his house and demanded the men be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Unwilling to issue a capital sentence on the spot, the alderman instead chose to travel to Castle Grinsted, the seat of Count Jeskin Sebroski, Koric's liege, in order to avoid having to make the judgement himself. This action allowed the adventurers time to investigate the issue further, as they suspected there were sinister forces at work in the village.",
			"Koric would later return from Castle Grinsted with the count, who wished to deal with the issues in Rythlon personally. After the adventurers returned with evidence against Teliril, and a trial-turned-battle, the Count Jeskin decided to remove Koric from his position in favor of Imizael Clathara, who had showed herself to be a more suitable individual for the role of steward of Rythlon.",
			"It is not clear what Koric would do with himself after his dismissal from the position of Alderman."
