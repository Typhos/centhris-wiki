      "@+Lurking Abominations+@ are terrifying skeletal creatures composed of the bones of numerous dead animals, people, or a combination of both. Abominations most commonly occur when numerous bodies are left to decompose in large pits or in mass graves. The lingering resentment and malice of the departed combines into a violent spectral force, which lashes out at any living who might foolishly wander too close.",
      "When a victim does come near a corpse or bone pile, the abomination will take whatever bones it can must and form a large construct of bone. The spirits that give this shambling horror locomotion swirl around it, repairing or replacing parts of the construct that might be damaged as the abomination tears its victim to shreds.",
      "Once it has killed the unsuspecting victim, the spirits will return the bones to their resting place, adding their latest victim to the pile, further increasing their malicious undead power."

When moving, liches seeme to glide as if floating on water.",

Having achieved lichdom several hundred years prior to his complete domination of the Kingdom of Istagen, the lich found that though many wizards publicly spoke out against the practice of magical undeath, in private they were far more willing to entertain such ideas. Thus, the lich lord slowly began to find willing mages whom he felt were worthy (and subservient) enough to join his inner circle, which would eventually grow to become known as the Council of the Withered King.",
        "Once a wizard had accepted the terms of his dark bargain, @~Shulxaa~@ would create for them a phylactery in which the mage would transfer their life force, becoming a lich. However, the secret of the creation of such objects, as well as their individual hiding places, were never shared with his servants, as a means of control by the Lich Lord. Thus, the council members, even if they might be tempted, would never overly act against their master. Shulxaa also went to great lengths over the course of his reign over Istagen to ensure that the knowledge of how to create a phylactery was never available to his servants, as a further way to ensure their loyalty."

      "The Lesser Lich's Phylactery": [
        "The process of achieving lichdom requires that the spellcaster construct a powerful magical artifact, a phylactery, in which the lich stores its life essence. As long as this phylactery is unharmed, the lich is immortal and can attempt to reassemble if it is ever vanquished (this happens within 10 days after its apparent destruction). Liches take great care in protecting their phylactery from harm, employing decoys, traps, and other defenses. Lesser liches guard their soul containers even more jealously than a true lich, if such a thing were possible, as they do not have the required knowledge create their own. Instead, they are closer to thralls, relying on the knowledge of a master lich, in order to store their soul in a phylactery."
