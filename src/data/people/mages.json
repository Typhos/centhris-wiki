      "Vythica Floshin is a half-elf woman who resides by herself in a large stone house in Rythlon. A wizard of some manner, the Lost Shields encountered her when Murat wished to have his master's staff identified. She offered to do so in exchange for him helping her clean up her library; a task Murat to do rather poorly. Though she attempted to engage Murat in further pleasantries, the monk was quick to leave her house after she identified the staff, leaving her dejected at the rare chance for company."

More directly, it is her job to root out possible corrupting influences from Navolinian society. Fitting someone of her given role, she has an extensive knowledge of cults, deities and the planes. She is also responsible for the retrieval of elements of cultural importance for study, or items of great danger to civilization for containment at the Tower of Stantorr.",
        "A divisive figure in Navolin, she has earned a reputation as a master manipulator and die hard believer in the importance of her cause. Those who value social order and rigid structures view her as a hero who will go at great lengths to achieve her goals. Those who value personal freedom and unique cultural identities tend to view her as little more than a bully, thief and dismantler of cultural heritage."

Often they will infiltrate occult organizations or attempt to manipulate known members of cabals into slowly destroying the organization from the inside naturally. When this does not work, or the situation proves too far along, the archmage and her allies will approach a situation with a scorched earth mentality. They feel it better to aggressively remove the cancer from society than to miss a portion and have it reappear later, possibly even more dangerous than before.",
