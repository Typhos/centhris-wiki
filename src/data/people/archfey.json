It is unclear the extent of her power, and some followers consider her a god, or demi-god of nature in her own right. This has led many religious scholars who become aware of her existence to question her relationship with the Sage, with some postulating that she might even be the Sage herself, an avatar of the goddess, or possibly that the two are in conflict over the dominion of nature."

She concludes that a beautiful relic in the hands of a repugnant person is a wrong that needs righting. To separate the two, she opens with persuasion, but fey persuasion is inextricable from magical might.",
        "When she encounters a mortal that captures here interest, she will often orchestrate a trial for them, which ends with the discovery of a great, often dangerous, secret. This can often come in the form of a fey in mortal guise who apparently requires saving."

This could be as simple as telling mortals of the powerful magic items that a Seelie fey possess, or something impossibly byzantine involving capturing three stable-boys (one of which has a latent sorcerous talent), invoking the curse of deadly nightshade on the princess whose parents snubbed His Darkly Imperious Majesty, or leading mortals into the Feywild simply to delight in their terror upon realizing they have been trapped in the Wild Lands.",
