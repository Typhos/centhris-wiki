A wizard of some manner, the Adventurers encountered her when Murat wished to have his master's staff identified. She offered to do so in exchange for him helping her clean up her library; a task Murat to do rather poorly. Though she attempted to engage Murat in further pleasantries, the monk was quick to leave her house after she identified the staff, leaving her dejected at the rare chance for company."

He drives an ostentatious wagon, on which he mounts various symbols of the occult, along with a staggering number of raven skulls. When asked where he is from, Reanold first responded that was 'not from around here', but after becoming more friendly with the Adventurers, he revealed he was from a place he referred to as 'Maison du Corbeau'.",
      "At first, the halfling simply saw the group as a way to earn some coin, selling them several minor magical items in exchange for some coin and a favor. However, following the group's return to Rythlon after killing the Lady of the Wood, Reanold intervened when Teliril cast Raise Dead on the hag's corpse. Using his Bardic talents, Reanold severed the magical tethers that were animating the corpse, allowing the Adventurers a change to prove their innocence to Count Jeskin Sebroski.",
      "After the completion of the trial and the death of Teliril, Reanold called upon Filibert to complete his bargain and sent the group off to look for his assistant, Leiana, who had run off with a magical figurine that Reanold uses to summon the horses that pull his wagon. The woman had last been seen at a place called 'the Bone Mill' north of the village. The only sign of the woman was scraps of a red cloak and drag marks inside the mill. With Leiana nowhere to be seen, the group returned with the figurine, completing Reanold's request."
