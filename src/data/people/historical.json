      "Khorohr of Thellodur was one of the greatest generals of Dol Obok who served the High King during the Great Expansion of the dwarves into the Pillars of Amud. He is best known in the modern era for his writing of the Codex of Vigilence, a treatise on the arts of valor, warfare, battle tactics and campaign strategy. The Codex is considered one of the greatest works of dwarven poetry ever written and in its original Dwarven can be sung as a battle hymn. Sadly, it loses this quality when translated."
