His palace, a fabulous complex made of brass and black stone known as the Molten Halls, was the seat of his power when he resided on the Material Plane. While he ruled the area, Akad demanded tribute from all under his dominion and bound many beings to his service. He would store his treasures in a pool of super-heated mercury, in which he enslaved several Azer, including Uster and Tyda, to guard and act as valets.",

      "@+Zoltheraz+@, better known in historical archives as @*the Ghoul King*@, was a lich and councilor to Shulxaa during his reign over the Kingdom of Istagen. Born Ivak of Dardon, the lich would spend nearly 50 years as a renowned eldritch knight and defender of the borderlands along the Desolate Wastes."

        "In 2C 2082, Ivak came across a strange old man wandering the roads north of Luzzara who immediately recognized the knight's talent for the arcane. The old man challenged the knight to a duel, which Ivak immediately dismissed. The proud knight had no intention of dueling an old, feeble man along the road. To this response, the old man simply laughed and called the cavalier a coward, and declared himself the victor by forfeit. Ivak, unwilling to withstand the bitter barbs, agreed and announced he would put the old man in his place.",
        "With the challenge accepted, the traveler suddenly flew through the air, hurly a barrage of dark magic at the knight, who used his own magic to protect him. The elder then cast off his tattered robes, revealing himself as the lich Shulxaa and in a horrible display of power, unleashed a deadly bleam of arcane energy which burst through the knight's chest.",
        "As he lay dying on the ground, Ivak spat curses at the undead wizard for his treachery and vowed revenge. At this, Shulxaa simply laughed yet again and declared that if Ivak wished to get his revenge, he would allow him all the time he required. Shulxaa explained his pact with Ivak, who was so consumed with the desire for revenge he agreed, not considering the true nature of his choice. With a bargain struck, the lic lord placed the knight's soul into a vessel of his own design, and plunged Sir Ivak to the ranks of the undead. His newest councilor risen, the lich declared that the knight could attempt to take his revenge whenever and as often he wished, but only if the knight followed him back to his study for tea."
