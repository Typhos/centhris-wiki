Though a brilliant military mind, he lacks the inspiring presence and oratory skills of more charismatic members of the Clan Council, partly due to his speech impediment, a lisp related to a birth defect."

The clan chieftain is well versed in the history between Lemuria and its northern neighbors. He does not wish for his homeland to suffer another loss like the War of Red Claws. The loss of Lepkar is an embarrassment that many Lemurians wish to forget, but Torild seems to view it as a cautionary tale which might repeat itself, should he not defend his homeland from its more aggressive foreign neighbors.",
        "Torild has a blunt, pragmatic personality. Though an effective tactician, he has never had a stomach for the skullduggery of politics. If accused of possible misdeeds, he simply laughs off the very the idea of his involvement in any plots. If pressed, he open offers to let investigators interview his men and check his military records for signs of misdeeds, illicit spending by his quartermasters or improper use of messengers.",
        "The general does bemoan the apparent interception of communications and the difficulty it has caused in supplying his troops. He notes, however, that his spies across the border have reported similar acts of sabotage occurring to the Tovani forces. He has no explanation for this, as he has not ordered his scouts, spies or any other forces to take action beyond the front lines.",
        "(@*In reality, the sabotage on both sides is being committed by agents loyal to the*@ Council of the Withered King)"

The chieftain has chosen to keep the reason for such actions private, a right afforded to clans when dealing with internal matters. His continued absence has started to cause friction among the other members of the council, with some chieftains calling for his seat to filled by a clan more available to the duty of governing.

This strain of the curse was purposefully chosen because werebears can temper themselves and reject their hysterical bloodlust. These champions, once chosen and cursed, leave the clan and enter the Eldskog forest, guarding the ancient temples that lie within.",
        "Viljar has been dealing with a large outbreak of unwanted lycanthropy on @*Eldskog Isle*@. It seems a renegade champion has begun to spread the curse of the werebear among clan members against the ancient tradition of the clan. Viljar has opted to keep the reason for his return to Eldskog a secret, not wanting to raise concerns about his clan's ability to deal with its internal problems. If the clan's ancient practice of intentionally cursing its warriors with lycanthropy to guard its lands were to become well known, it could lead to a loss of their position on the Clan Council of Lemuria."
