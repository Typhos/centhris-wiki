This period of tense peace lasted for less than thirty years before tensions flared yet again, and the Second Guild War began.

During the conflict, thousands of lives were lost and the number of operating guilds in the city dropped by nearly two thirds.",

      "Hovering in the hottest areas of the Plane of Fire, the City of Brass sits on an enormous disc of brass. A wall of ornate brass surrounds the entire city, giving the city its name. However, since the brass disc gives the city its ability to fly, (albeit slowly,) these impressive walls were typically unmanned. Throughout the cosmopolitan city, the increible heat of the Elemental Plane of Fire is suppressed by the will of the Grand Sultan in an effort to foster interplanar trade. Despite this, the city itself has a hindering effect on creatures cosmically aligned towards good, due partly to the nature of the efreet, but also to the numerous connecting portals with the Nine Hells.",

      "The City of Brass is governed by the undisputed Sultan of the Efreet, who rules the city with a tyrannical hold over his subjects. On occasion, the Sultan will oversee important legal matters of noble efreet but mostly focuses on wider politics. Although the Sultan is the paramount authority in the City of Brass, he generally delegates the day-to-day affairs to his vizier. The title of Grand Sultan is held by Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan.",
      "Most efreet pledge their fealty to the Grand Sultan, whether they resided in the city or not. Even those residing in settlements outside of the city consider it their capital.",
      "Although the streets of the city are bustling with trade and crammed with crowds during the day, by night a strict curfew is enforced by the Illuminated, the guards of the city. All shops are shut up and all citizens must return to their homes, else face arrest, the loss of a hand, enslavement, or even death.",
      "Slaves are obligated to bear bracelets that display their servitude and who their master is at all times. It is common for visitors to the city to become slaves by defaulting on borrowed money. In addition, this servitude can be extended by additional offenses that can add days or even years to their thralldom."

Many structures have long crumbled into ruin, though many great monuments, temples and public works can still be found throughout the area. Superstitious travelers steer well clear of the valley, and claim they have seen or hear tales of terrible, nightmarish creatures that wander the valley at night. Other claim they have seen huge, winged creatures circle the crags and ruins, openly displaying their power and ownership of the valley to anyone who might challenge their dominance."
