        "You magically binds the fate of @;two creatures;@ by ethereal strings visible only to you. All @;damage;@ and @;magical effects;@ that affect one creature affects the other as well. Each creature that is the target of this spell must make a @;Wisdom saving throw;@. A creature that fails its saving throw has its ethereal threads of fate bound by the caster.",
        "If @;both creatures;@ fail their saving throws, the spell takes effect immediately. If @;only one creature;@ fails its save, that creature has its fate bound by the spell and the caster may attempt to bind a new creature other than the original targets as a @;bonus action;@ so long as concentration of the spell is maintained. A @;willing creature;@ does not need to make a save against the spell effect.",
        "@+At Higher Levels.+@ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the caster may choose an additional target."
