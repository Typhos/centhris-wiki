These places of power, of which each lords controls only one, are personal domains where they have absolute power. These dark masters almost never interact with each other, as they are essentially unable to leave their own domains; the exception to this seems to be the city of Gloomwrought, where all the denizens of the Shadowfell may tread. It is extremely rare to see a fell lord in @~Gloomwrought~@, even if they are able to travel to it, since they are at their weakest when in the City of Shadow.
