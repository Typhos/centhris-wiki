When Evan-Jakob disturbed the scrap of fabric, the piles of bone began to shift and a horrible monstrosity coalesced from the discarded skeletons. The Lurking Abomination, a horrible nightmarish creature with four arms burst forth to attack the Adventurers. After enduring a furious assault, the group was able to destroy the creature.",
      "Venturing inside the mill, the Adventurers discovered found the interior nearly monocromatic, as if all color had been removed from it. Taking great care, they searched the building and found no further signs of Leiana, though they did find further shreds of red fabric. Murat investigated what might have happened to the woman, and determined that she possibly had been taken to the wall, but there were no signs of a door and no exit on the exterior of the mill."
