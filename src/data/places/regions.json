The more cairns, runestones and other commemorative decorations were placed on a mound, the more important the tomb. Is is customary for a clan noble to receive a single runestone and cairn. Clan chiefs generally are marked with 2 cairns and a runestone, while chieftains are marked with 2 cairns and 2 runestones. Very few lords of Arnbjorg were ever granted any more prominent barrow caps, though Drelnor Arnbjorg's barrow mound was marked with 3 cairns and 2 runestones, proving that the practice is not unheard of.",
