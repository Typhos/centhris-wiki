      "The Archduchy of Zurast is a growing regional power in eastern Ulfwyst. Several hundred years ago, the City of Zurast was an ordinary city-state located on the southern Sulas river near the Bay of Claws. Only within the last 60 years, through military expansion and shrewd political maneuvering, have the archdukes of Zurast successfully expanded and maintained their position as a respected regional power. As Zurast does not have a large standing military of its own, this expansion was mostly paved by foreign mercenaries. It is unclear where the Archduchy acquired such a sudden influx of wealth to be able to afford its mercenary armies, though there are many rumors bandied about."

Over the millennia amongst the crags, glaciers, ice flows and howling woods, the people have developed an understanding with the land they inhabit."

      "People of the Land": [
        "Due to the vast amount of natural wilderness that exists in this remote region of Ulfwyst, there is an innate connection in Lemuria with the Feywild. Many people claim to see fey spirits roaming the hills or dancing in the ancient forests.",
        "With this fey connection comes a peculiar phenomena: Lemuria has the highest concentration of half-elves in all of Ulfwyst, possibly in all of Centhris. It is not uncommon for a man or woman to disappear for years at a time, only to return from some far off place with a child in tow, a reminder of fleeting tryst with a fey from beyond the mortal realms. Half-elves are viewed as normal, or in some eyes, blessed people who have been touched by the realms beyond."
      ],
      "Settlements":[
        "Most of the people of Lemuria live in isolated, fortified villages and towns located at defendable positions in the landscape. Frotified hill-towns, sea-side ports located on the sides of cliffs and walled villages located deep in forests are typical fare for the people of Lemuria."

      "Masters of the Sea":[
        "Many towns in Lemuria are located along a river or on the coast. The people of this land have a healthy respect and a deep bond with the sea. Any person worth their salt knows how to handle a boat and can sail on a river, at the very least. Due to this cultural expectation, Lemurians are generally considered the most skilled sailors in Ulfwyst and it is common to find a merchant vessel in cities such as Volikgrad or Braxinfurt being commanded by a Lemurian captain."

      "Religion":[
        "Lemuria is an ancient and mystical land, full of haunted woods, deadly mires and frozen peaks. The people have mixed the traditional gods of Ulfwyst and their own, more ancient traditions.",
        "Almost every village and town in the kingdom has a temple dedicated to the gods, and also a sacred grove dedicated to the spirits of the land. This animist practice honors the spirits of the forest, rocks, river, mountains and sea with which the people of this place share a sacred bond. The people of Lemuria believe that though the gods hold supreme power over the world, their day to day lives are more influenced by the natural spirits all around them.",
        "To the people of Lemuria, it is as important to honor the local spirits as it is the Gods. Throughout the year, various rites, festivals and holidays mark the occasions important to the animist practices. When the spring crops are sown, a village will hold a festival to honor the spirits of the fields, the orchards and the streams. When a lamb is born or an old beast of burden dies, its spirit is honored in ancient rites at a family's ritual altar."
      ],
      "Sacred Monuments":[
        "In these sacred groves, druids and priests erect great stone circles dedicated to the spirits of the land. It is also a common tradition amongst the great clans to mark the rite of adulthood by placing a great runestone in a sacred location near the clan's hold. The head of the clan generally commissions the stone and then the clan, lead by the soon-to-be adult carry the stone to the destined location, planting the stone to mark the auspicious occasion."

It is for this reason that the armies of Syrothia terrify their enemies. Entire legions will, if tactics require, throw themselves at a stronghold or into a lost cause. For the goblinoids are fully aware that while any casualties they inflict upon the enemy is permanent, the damage suffered on their end is only temporary.",
