Safely across the river from the Twisting Warrens, it was a safe place to settle while still having access to the old city's ruins for building materials. As the city expanded, the tight alleys and cramped streets of district left much to be desired and most immigrants preferred the city planning of the other districts."

Tightly packed and full of old, dry, wooden buildings, the district was ripe for a devastating fire. It was only through the intervention of the guilds of Rakenburg and several private adventuring companies that more of the city was not caught up in the blaze.",
        "After the fire, the Guild Council of Rakenburg set about re-planning and rebuilding the district, as it was still inside the city walls and it was only a matter of time before the displaced populace of Oldtown became restless. Using funds set aside for other projects, the Guild Council began rebuilding the district at a blazing pace. Within 15 years, the entire district was completely transformed."
