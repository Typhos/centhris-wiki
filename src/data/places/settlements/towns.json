Those who break the code face mob justice at the hands of the violent citizenry. The code includes the following provisions:",
        "• \"@*None shall make use of hostile magicks while within city limits. Any found doing so will be banished. Any soul who does so in an action which results in the injury or death of another man shall suffer death.*@\"",
        "• \"@*Every man shall have an equal vote in affairs of moment. He shall have an equal title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized, and shall use them at pleasure unless a scarcity makes it necessary for the common good that a retrenchment may be voted.*@\"",
        "• \"@*Every man shall be called fairly in turn by the list on board of prizes, because over and above their proper share, they are allowed a shift of clothes. But if they defraud the company to the value of even one dollar in plate, jewels, or money, they shall be marooned. If any man rob another, he shall have his nose and ears slit, and be put ashore where he shall be sure to encounter hardships.*@\"",
        "• \"@*He that shall desert the ship or his quarters in the time of battle shall be punished by death or marooning.*@\"",
        "• \"@*None shall strike another on board the ship, but every man's quarrel shall be ended onshore by sword or pistol in this manner: at the word of command from the Quartermaster, each man being previously placed back to back, shall turn and fire immediately. If any man do not, the Quartermaster shall knock the piece out of his hand. If both miss their aim, they shall take to their cutlasses, and he that draws first blood shall be declared the victor.*@\"",
        "• \"@*Every man who shall become a cripple or lose a limb in the service shall have three hundred hulls from the common stock, and for lesser hurts proportionately.*@\"",
        "• \"@*The Captain and the Quartermaster shall each receive two shares of a prize, the Master Gunner and Boatswain, one and one half shares, all other officers one and one quarter, and private gentlemen of fortune one share each.*@\"",
        "• \"@*The musicians shall have rest every fifth day, by right, on all other days, by favor only.*@\""
