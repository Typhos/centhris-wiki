In the rear of the cave system is an entrance to a series of ruined halls, where the coven would conduct foul rituals. The grotto was also the prison of the Bloody King of Hearts, a devil that the Lost Shields encountered while exploring the complex.",
      "At some point in the recent past, a band of sellswords known as the Iron Fangs tracked down the coven and managed to slay two of the three hags. With the coven effectively destroyed, and the whereabouts of the final witch unknown, the dungeon fell into disuse and its fiendish resident was left alone in his prison with no means of escape."

The two men had decided, with the influence of too much alcohol, to relive the glory days of their youth when they were promising adventurers. They ventured into the grotto, and though they survived the ordeal, Rakas was inflicted with a curse when he foolishly touched the Foul Iron Cauldron that the coven had used as a conduit for their rituals. His friend afflicted with an unknown ailment, Lormin dragged his friend from the cave and made a hasty retreat back to Rythlon."

      "Two Very Different Contracts": [
        "Several weeks later, with the arrival of the Lost Shields, Lormin saw an opportunity for Rakas to be cured. Seeking out the band after they defeated a small incursion of dark creatures inside the Moody Acrobat and Rythlon village square, the half-orc offered the band a job. In exchange for 100 gold pieces, he wished for them to return to the grotto and have Lirr Stonebreath cleanse the cauldron within using a vial of holy water.",
        "Agreeing to the request, the Lost Shields set off to the grotto, about a day's journey on foot from the village. Entering the cave, the group made quick work of several monstrous spiders, a series of traps and the coven's strange, twisted, fey minions that guarded the cauldron. Lirr cleansed the cauldron of its corrupting magic using the holy water. However, before they could vacate the hollow, the group encountered the imprisoned devil which the witches had trapped in a large room.",
        "The group spoke at length with the fiend, though they were not able to physically see him, attempting to understand why he was there. After a frustrating series of riddles, half-answers and temptations, the band decided to leave. Mortified of being left to rot in his prison once again, the devil offered to bind himself to the group with a favor if they broke one of the two seals that trapped him in the room.",
        "Though most of the Lost Shields felt this was too dangerous, Evan-Jakob agreed and destroyed one of the magic circles with his sword. The devil, bound to keep his end of the bargain, requested an item through which he could be contacted when the group wished to call in their favor. The warlock produced a deck of cards and produced the King of Hearts from the deck. The devil then slashed its hand and allowed a few droplets of blood to land on the playing card. The Bloody King of Hearts, now so named, then vanished from sight once again, now free to roam the Material Plane once again."

In their original state the Molten Halls were a huge, regal complex of basalt rock inlaid with dazzling bronze motifs. After Akad was banished from the material plane by the wizards Amabilis & Menodora, the palace was quickly forgotten. Before leaving the palace, the wizards damaged the palace's inter-dimensional waygate, ensuring that no creatures from the City of Brass or the Elemental Plane of Fire could return to the Palace."

      "Design & Layout": [
        "The Molten Halls were formed at the base of the Jordonis Mountains. Not truly constructed, instead the halls were shaped by the elemental powers of its master and his servants. Mamga from deep underground was brought up from the lower places of the word to flow freely through the palace. The result is a strangely beautiful sight, but one that is difficult to withstand physically. The interior of the palace is insufferably hot and most mortals can only spend a limit amount of time within before suffering the ill effects.",
        "The palace itself consists of a variety of opulent corridors, audience chambers and lounges. The functional rooms of the palace were limited to only a few important spaces. These include the Waygate Bridge, the Blazing Forge, the Rookery, the Magma Baths, the Mercury Vault and the Molten Throne Room."

      "The Mercury Vault": [
        "If there is one room in the entire palace that has intrigued would-be explorers for centuries, it is the Mercury Vault of the Molten Halls. Fabled to be an enormous pool of super-heated mercury somewhere in the halls, the vault is where the efreet lord stored his most valuable magical artifacts, which were unaffected by the corrosive vapors or extreme heat of the pool. Scholars disagree on how deep the pool must be, but it is assumed to be between ten and twenty feet deep. The pool is not enough to melt most living beings on contact with the surface and the vault room itself is filled with a lingering noxious vapor. Exposure for more than a few minutes is enough to cause the neurological and behavior changes associated with mercury poisoning.",
        "Though unaffected by the heat or hazardous nature of the vault, Akad the Magnificent was far too proud to store and retrieve things from his vault in his own palace. As such, he conscripted two Azer, Uster and Tyda, which were bonded to his service to serve as valets in the Vault. These beings were magically bound to the room and have remained in the halls even after Akad's banishment.",
        "It is unknown exactly what kind or how much treasure is still under the surface of the super-heated mercury, but few have determined an effective means of retrieving anything that might still remain within."

Populations centers near the epicenter were completely destroyed as reality buckled and quaked. Places that were not annihilated by this altering of the fabric of reality were instead subject to acute planar shifts and alterations. Vesunna, not close enough to the epicenter to be completely destroyed, was instead sent shifting through planar subspaces. Parts of the city simply collapsed and fell into ruin, while others managed to remain preserved, though lost beyond the material plane.",

Knowing the risks of beginning their experiments on relative weak mortals, the mages instead experimented on a variety of creatures which they deemed worth 'upgrading'. They experiments were met with both intriguing successes and horrifying failures.",
        "Eventually, once they were satisfied with more mundane creatures, the mages moved on to attempting to improve creatures that were already considered to be at the apex of creation. Creatures that garnered interest included the sphinx, roc, remorhaz and dragon. Diolanum's experiments led to a variety of variant sub-species, includeing the Storm Roc, the Sand Remorhaz, and the Dracolisk.",
        "As the researchers grew bolder, their experiments turned to humanoids. Successful experiments with humanoid races led to the creation of a variety of unusual hybrid species, including the Anubari, the Sêrbonji, and the Uklang. Failures were discarded remorselessly into the bowels of the city, and while some perished, other thrived as a twisted mutants. The worst failures of experiments gone wrong were treated even more harshly. If a subject was deemed too violet, deadly, or aberrant, the mages would exile it into the Shadowfell, forever to wander in the a dark, twisted nightmare realm. Though cruel, the cabal deemed this the most efficient way to ensure that these failures could not escape and harm the people of Vesunna."

Among some of the most impressive was the efficient mass creation of iron golems for use around the empire. These golems, known to the Utharian as Ferrum Virorum Fortium (Valiant Iron Soldiers), became a stable of Utharian life during the height of the Imperium. Every major city in the empire, as well as most noble estates and arcane centers of learning were provided with golems to patrol and defend from outside threats.",
        "After the Ruination of Centhris and the fall of the empire, the golems became dormant. Many were simply harvested by the surviving peoples in the decades that followed, as they were an excellent source of high quality metals and the knowledge of the magic that powered the creatures had been effectively lost.",
        "Not all of the Ferrum Virorum Fortium were destroyed. In places that were completely abandoned or devastated by the Ruination, the golems were simply forgotten. Magical in nature, they did not deteriorate or rust. In these forgotten places, they waited for a new master."

        "When Rakenburg was resettled, the old city ruins were well over 1,000 years old. The first settlers assumed that the iron hulks scattered about the ruins were still active and avoided them extensively. It was with the arrival of the tiefling Artificer Eskra Gradiorus in 2C 2215 that this changed. Gradiorus, an inquisitive inventor, was immediately taken by the golems and paid several men 30 hulls each to carry one across the Kamsby to her workshop. Over the next several years, the tiefling worked tirelessly to reverse engineer the techniques used in the golem's creation and activation. In 2C 2227, 12 years after the golem was first hauled to her workshop, Eskra was able to reactivate a Ferrum Virorum Fortium for the first time in a millenia.",
        "After numerous years of working in relative isolation, Artificer Gradiorus became a founding member of the Specular Arcanum. Bringing her expertise to her new job, she began the mass re-purposing of the ancient golems of Vesunna to serve the contemporary residents of the city. Linking all of the golems to a central control system, the artificer reprogrammed the constructs, now dubbed Gradiorus Golems or Gradiori after her, to contain the complete city code of Rakenburg, follow the commands of Spec officers, and operate as autonomous units if required."

Their kind extracted ore from the veins of the world, freed stunning gems from the stone and carved great halls in which their songs and fables could be recounted. For centuries, this place stood as a testament to the greatness of their kind. The citadel withstood many threats, both from without and within. Mad nobles, wild beasts and invasions of hostile neighbors all threated to tear the hold asunder. No one alive today knows exactly what happened to bring down Õsed'ushang, but it now only remains as ruin. Great caverns once filled with light, mirth and industry now sit dark, cold and empty. Other creatures now call this place home. Dark beasts and insidious cults now call this place home, jealously guarding its secrets for themselves."

Carved out deep below Mount Thundermane, the city was ruled by the great dwarf Thane Gohdur Stormbreaker. Under his vision and leadership, the dwarves of Õsed'ushang forged legendary works of iron and gold, carved magnificent engravings, and forged flawless jewelry.",
        "Õsed'ushang is also one of the ancestral homes of the Dwarven craft of Runecarving. It was here that the first runesmith of Entos, Engrun Wildheart, discovered the art of imbuing weapons, armor, and all manner of mundane objects with magical runes; granting these objects magic powers without the dangers associated with arcane magics.",
        "At its height, Õsed'ushang was home to thousands of dwarves, all working towards a common legend. Yet, nothing lasts forever. Eventually, the enemies of the dwarves set their sights upon the riches of Õsed'ushang. The stoic citizens, lead by their thane and protected by their noble guard, the Gryphons of Steel, held fast for decades. Monsters, invaders and thieves all attempted to set foot in the hold, but to no avail.",
        "At last, 1,200 years ago, Õsed'ushang fell. After decades of strife, the resources below the great city ran dry and the treasury began to empty. The economy of Osed'ushang collapsed as the miners could find no new veins of gold, silver or iron. Dwarves began to emigrate to new places and in a weakened state, the enemies of Osed'ushang found their moment to strike. It is not clear exact which foe struck the final blow, only that the citadel was lost to the ages. It now sits, a monument to the great achievements of a proud race, and a tomb to its most noble defenders."

The section of the city closest to the surface, this area sits above the tree line, and great viewing spaces were created from which the dwarves of the city could peer out over the landscape.",
        "Over the centuries without proper maintenance, the elements took their toll. Decades of rain and snowfall damaged the fine stonework and caused extensive flooding throughout the upper chambers, leading to a strange, unnatural environment. As water settled in areas throughout the Upper Ring, it pooled into stagnant ponds. Due to the constant rising heat from the undermountain levels, Etar-Kalur became an eerie unnatural bog.
