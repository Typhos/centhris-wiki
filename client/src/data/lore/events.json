        "The ruination was incited by the Grand Magistrix of the Utharian Empire, Erèdin Esk Zarlaya. The sorcerer had spent years researching the limits of arcane theory and slowly descended into megalomania. Discontent with his own mortality and finding the possibility of elevating himself to lichdom like some of his peers, Erèdin search for a more permanent, and terrible solution. After years of research which drove him to madness, the mage found the final solution to his plight: ascend to godhood by infusing himself with the very essence of magic from which the people of the Utharian Empire drew power, the Endanólemë.",
        "On the 12th of Heskur, 2C 837, Erèdin entered the Sanctuary of Arcana, and cast himself into the Endanólemë. Those in the temple at first assumed he had committed suicide, as no being could possibly survive contact with a pure, untamed source of wild magic. Erèdin, however, did not perish, for he had been studying how to absorb and contain impossibly large bursts of leyline magic for years. In one incredible moment of unthinkable avarice, the sorcerer absorbed every drop of magical essence granted by the nexus, ascending to godhood in the process. This act, unimaginably cruel, robbed his people of the very source of their power. In the moment of his ascent, Erèdin absorbed all magic granted by the Endanólemë, killing thousands of powerful mages who drew upon the source in an instant, as he absorbed their life essence.",
        "With his ascent complete, the new god, later to be dubbed the Stygian by scholars, left the mortal plane with a thought. The leyline nexus at the heart of Thyra, which had been completely drained, began to collapse in meer moments, creating a massive magical vortex in the void."

        "According to the account in the @*Darsam Thîkut*@, the universe was initially a infinite, chaotic void known as Kisatnïr. In this void there dwelled an endless number of primordial entities known as the Angzak'ekur (referred to in @*Common*@ as the Obyrith). There then appeared a blinding spark, and after it the gods. The @~gods~@ used the roiling, chaos of Kisatnïr to form the first realm of existence, known as Utharàm.",
        "In this place, the @~gods~@ built the divine city, the stronghold known as Tanrilar. The @~gods~@ each then set upon adding elements of their own design to Utharàm, and for a time this new realm flourished.",
        "However, the Angzak'ekur did not take kindly to the invasion of their reality by the @~gods~@ and set their creations, the demons, upon Utharàm with great fury. The greatest of the demons, the Fiend, sundered the @~gods~@' creation, scattering it across the universe. As they separated, each piece of Utharàm formed its own realm of existence, completely cut off from the others.",
        "The @~gods~@, enraged by the destruction of their creation, engaged the primordials and their demonic servants in battle across the cosmos. For untold eons the sides remained locked in battle with no side gaining the upper hand. That is, until the arrival of the dragon twins, Bahamut and Tiamat. The @~gods~@, along with their new draconic allies,set upon the demonic hordes, driving them back to the mouth of the Burning Abyss, the twisting heart of all chaos in the cosmos. However, the @~gods~@ and their servants, the deva, could not enter into the Abyss.",
        "While the @~gods~@ debated what to do regarding the Abyss, an otherworldly, celestial being stepped foot into the halls of the divine city. This strange, alien presence referred to itself as Kezolet, the Arbiter, and announced that during the battle it had safeguarded and hidden away a tiny fragment of Utharàm which has been left to float freely through time and space. Filled with mortal life, @~the Arbiter~@ referred to this material plane as Centhris.",
        "Intrigued, the @~gods~@ gazed upon this small shard of Utharàm with interest and found the planet filled with all manner of life: giants, humanoids, monstrosities and, unexpectedly, elementals which entered the realm as it drifted through the Elemental Chaos.",
        "It was then that another unknown, divine entity calling himself Asmodeus arrived in the celestial hall. The new god offered a plan to contain the Angzak'ekur. @~Asmodeus~@ offered to build a new realm known as Gedor'Shash, the Nine Hells. He offered to stand guard against the eternal demonic threat, so long as he would be given command of an army with which to guard the Abyss. The gods agreed, offering him the newly discovered souls of wicked or corrupt mortals to use in this fight and granted upon him the title of Master of the @~Nine Hells~@.",
        "The demonic threat seeming dealt with, at least temporarily, the @~gods~@ turned their attention once again to the surviving piece of their grand creation. The more passive gods simply watched from afar, while those with a more inquisitive or intrusive nature offered guidance to their creations."

Mortals from both Centhris and the feywild were able to cross between the planes freely. Though some peoples from the material plane did cross into the Feywild, the dangers of the wild realm quickly proved too dangerous for extensive exploration or settlement. Residents of the Feywild, however, did migrate in large numbers from the Feywild to Centhris~@. Fey creatures, such as pixies, hags, sprites, centaurs, satyrs, trolls, dryads and all manner of other fey beings entered the material world for the first time. Mortal peoples, too, migrated into the world, including gnomes and eladrin, who would become known as the Avar."
