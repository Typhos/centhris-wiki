      "The art of @+Runesmithing+@ is an ancient smithing art created by the Ziril'udór to bind raw, arcane magic into runes of power. The art is an offshoot of traditional dwarven techniques. Those who take up the craft are referred to as \"@*runesmiths*@\". Runesmiths are revered in dwarven society for their skill and dedication to one of the most difficult artisanal traditions. It takes decades to master the techniques and memorize the patterns required to produce the most potent runes.",
      
      "@#History#@",

      "In the Age of Arcane Empires, the practice of arcane magic was common among the dwarven clans. Some of the most well-regarded mages, scholars and enchanters in the world belonged to the great dwarven clans of Dol Obok, Ushol Kezhan, Thol Torish and Nidvollir. Some remnants of their work still survive, usually in the form of magical items of incredible power and spells of elemental cold, fire or lightning.",
      
      "Following the Ruination, the surviving dwarves retreated into their mountain homes to recover from the calamity. Incredulous and stubborn by nature, the dwarves began to  blame arcane magic and its practitioners for the widespread destruction. Most dwarves of magical talent are either bards, or wizards - as beings of earth and stone, dwarve rarely produce sorcerers. Though not outright banned, the practice of learned arcane magic became frowned upon in the clans, with few dwarves willing to upset their families and ancestors by taking up such a dangerous, taboo art. Dwarven society, however, was still reliant on arcane magic to function. Many of the great dwarven cities and holds relied on magic for transportation, protection and even day-to-day life.",
      
      "The solution would eventually be invented by the first runesmith, Einarr Nýridja in the great hold of Osed'ushang. Master Nýridja discovered that through traditional smithing techniques, runesmiths could bind magical energy to items in a stable, predictable way by using a combination of glyphs to bind in the desired magical effect. Though not as powerful as traditional enchanting, and requiring far more time and skill to master, the art was found to be extremely stable and reliable.",
      
      "The practice would quickly spread throughout the dwarven holds as eager smiths sought ways to return their kingdoms to their former glory."

          "Creating runic items takes a great deal of effort, and Runesmiths don’t like repeating themselves. Nor do they copy other Runesmiths’ work, except during their apprenticeship. As such, runesmiths will rarely create multiple of a given type of runic item. Generally, runesmiths avoid forging items with the same combination of runes on a regular basis, often waiting months or years before they willingly forge an item with a set of runes they have used before.",

A second of the same rune increases the cost of forging the by ten fold.

Adding a third Rune of Immolation to a blade can only be achieved by the greatest Master Runesmiths at incredible time and material cost, meaning the item would now cost 25,000gp to forge.",

A smith must know the proper incantations, material components, rhythmic patterns of hammering and any other more esoteric requirements to forge a given rune. The most powerful runes might require a runesmith to hammer a specific pattern perfectly for 12 hours under the light of a waxing moon. A single missed swing or slip of the hand rending the rune worthless and inert. Others might require rare or dangerous materials, such as powdered dragonscale or the tongue of a mimic, or the item might require tempering or quenching in a specific liquid, such as fresh troll's blood, in order to activate the rune during forging. Each rune is different and temperamental. Beyond the material cost of a rune, the DM might require someone wishing to forge a rune blade to aid in the creation the item by helping perform part of these rites."
