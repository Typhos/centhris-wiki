      "The @+Council of the Withered King+@ was a group of liches that were subservient to Shulxaa, the Withered King.",
      "The Lich Lord of Istagen reigned over the Kingdom of Istagen for several hundred years prior to his defeat by the Knights of the Sacred Dawn. Having achieved lichdom hundreds of years prior to his complete domination of the Kingdom of Istagen, he found that though many wizards publicly spoke out against the practice of magical undeath, in private they were far more willing to entertain such ideas. Thus, @~Shulxaa~@ slowly began to find willing mages whom he felt were worthy (and subservient) enough to join his inner circle, which would eventually grow to become known as the Council of the Withered King.",
      "Once a wizard had accepted the terms of his dark bargain, Shulxaa would create for them a phylactery in which the mage would transfer their life force, becoming a lich. However, the secret of the creation of such objects, as well as their individual hiding places, were never shared with his servants, as a means of control by the Lich Lord. Thus, the council members, even if they might be tempted, would never overly act against their master. Shulxaa also went to great lengths over the course of his reign over Istagen to ensure that the knowledge of how to create a phylactery was never available to his servants, as a further way to ensure their loyalty."

Many members of the council, whose soul vessels were dispersed to ensure their survival, went into hiding in order to avoid the Knights of the Sacred Dawn. Though there were whispers of strange wizards among the peasants, the banishment of arcane practitioners from Tovanis forced the mages to flee out of the kingdom in order to avoid easy detection, should they use large-scale magic.",
        "Though some of the knights wished to hunt down and destroy the remaining liches, the decision was made to instead focus on rebuilding the realm and help the former subjects of the lich lord instead of chasing shadows. Thus, the council vanished into the wilds of Ulfwyst, only to be remembered in historical records, and the long memory of those driven to enact revenge against their reign of terror."
