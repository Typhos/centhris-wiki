      "The Lost Shields are an adventuring group which formed (informally) in the village of Rythlon in Sirngor of 2C 2573. After traveling for quite some time together, and shortly before joining the Ruby Phoenix guild in Rakenburg, the group decided upon their name. Though originally formed as an alliance of convenience in order to make some quick gold, the events in Rython, and then in the Molten Halls seemed to bind the group's fate to each other, as well as that of Uster, Shiavalae and Khazar."
